=== 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA ===

Dataset: Internet Advertisements Data Set
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Reference: Lichman, M. (2013). UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml]. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science.

Dataset Characteristics:
- Total samples: 3279 
- Total features: 1558 (numerical features + 1 target variable)
- Target variable: Binary classification ('ad' vs 'nonad')
- Missing values: 15 total (represented as '?')
- Data type: Numerical features describing image characteristics

Objective: Develop a classification model to predict whether an internet image is an advertisement or not
This is relevant for ad-blocking applications and content filtering systems

=== 2. CLEAN THE DATA ===

Data Loading Process:
- Successfully loaded 3279 samples with 1559 features
- Identified target variable with binary classification
- Detected missing values represented as '?'

Data Cleaning Steps:
1. Remove Index Column: Removed first column (row index)
2. Handle Missing Values: Replaced 15 missing values with median
3. Convert Target to Factor: Converted target to factor with levels: ad, nonad
4. Verify Data Quality: Verified no missing values remain

Final Clean Dataset: 3279 samples × 1559 variables ( 1558 features + 1 target)
Data quality: No remaining missing values, all features properly formatted

=== 3. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS ===

Target Variable Distribution:
- 'ad' class: 459 samples (14%)
- 'nonad' class: 2820 samples (86%)
- Class imbalance ratio: 1: 6.14 

Descriptive Statistics Summary:
- Mean values: Calculated for all numerical features
- Median values: Used for missing value imputation
- Standard deviation: High variability across features
- Range: Features span different scales (normalization applied for k-NN)

Visualizations Generated:
1. Bar chart showing class distribution (target_distribution.png)
2. Histograms for first 12 features (histograms.png)
3. Boxplots for first 12 features (boxplots.png)
4. Scatter plots for feature relationships (scatterplots.png)

Correlation Analysis:
- Analyzed correlation matrix for 10 features
- No high correlations (|r| > 0.7) detected
- Features appear to be relatively independent
- This supports the use of ensemble methods like Random Forest

=== 4. OBJECTIVE AND HOW TO ACHIEVE IT (STATISTICAL METHODS) ===

Project Objective:
To develop and compare machine learning classification models for predicting
whether internet images are advertisements or non-advertisements.
This addresses the practical problem of automated ad detection and filtering.

Statistical Methods Chosen (Not Learned in Class):
We implemented three advanced classification algorithms that were not covered
in the regular curriculum to explore different approaches to the classification problem:

1. KNN - Instance-based Learning:
   • Method: Distance-based classification using Euclidean distance
   • Rationale: Non-parametric method suitable for complex decision boundaries
   • Implementation: Custom distance calculation with Z-score normalization
   • Hyperparameter: k = 3 
   • Features used: All (normalized) 
   • Advantage: Simple, interpretable, no assumptions about data distribution

2. DECISION_TREE - Tree-based Learning:
   • Method: Recursive binary partitioning using Gini impurity criterion
   • Rationale: Provides interpretable decision rules for classification
   • Implementation: Custom recursive algorithm with stopping criteria
   • Configuration: max_depth = 3 , features = First 20 
   • Advantage: Highly interpretable, handles non-linear relationships

3. RANDOM_FOREST - Ensemble Learning:
   • Method: Bootstrap aggregating (bagging) of multiple decision trees
   • Rationale: Reduces overfitting while maintaining good predictive performance
   • Implementation: Custom ensemble with majority voting
   • Configuration: n_trees = 50 , features = All 
   • Advantage: Robust to overfitting, handles high-dimensional data well

Methodological Approach:
1. Data preprocessing and feature scaling (for k-NN)
2. Train-test split (70-30) with stratified sampling
3. Model training with hyperparameter optimization
4. Performance evaluation using multiple metrics
5. Comparative analysis to identify the best approach
