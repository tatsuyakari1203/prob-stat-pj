\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The proliferation of the internet has led to a massive increase in online advertising. While advertisements can be useful, they can also be intrusive and detract from the user experience. Therefore, the ability to automatically distinguish between advertising and non-advertising content is a significant challenge in modern data science. This project addresses this challenge by developing a model to classify internet images as either advertisements ('ad') or non-advertisements ('nonad').

This report details the process of analyzing the "Internet Advertisements Data Set" sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository \cite{lichman2013uci}. We will explore the data, clean it for analysis, and apply several machine learning models to build an effective classifier. The primary goal is to construct a robust model that can accurately predict whether an image is an advertisement based on its various features.
