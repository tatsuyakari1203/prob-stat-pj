\label{sec:conclusion}

\subsection{Project Summary}

This project successfully implemented and evaluated three machine learning algorithms for internet advertisement classification using the UCI Internet Advertisements dataset. The study compared k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms to determine their effectiveness in distinguishing between advertisement and non-advertisement images based on numerical features.

\subsection{Dataset Characteristics}

The analysis was conducted on a comprehensive dataset containing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Total samples:} 3,279 internet images
    \item \textbf{Features:} 1,559 numerical attributes describing image characteristics
    \item \textbf{Target classes:} Binary classification (advertisement vs. non-advertisement)
    \item \textbf{Data quality:} No missing values after preprocessing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Findings}

\subsubsection{Model Performance Comparison}

To evaluate the models, we used four standard metrics, each providing a different perspective on performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accuracy:} Measures the overall correctness of the model. It is the ratio of correctly predicted images to the total number of images.
    \item \textbf{Precision:} Answers the question: "Of all the images that the model labeled as an ad, how many were actually ads?" A high precision is crucial when the cost of a false positive (incorrectly blocking a non-ad) is high.
    \item \textbf{Recall (Sensitivity):} Answers the question: "Of all the actual ads, how many did the model correctly identify?" High recall is important when the goal is to miss as few ads as possible.
    \item \textbf{F1-Score:} The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. It provides a single score that balances the two, and is particularly useful for datasets with a class imbalance.
\end{itemize}

The comprehensive evaluation revealed distinct performance characteristics for each algorithm:

\caption{Final Model Performance Summary}
\label{tab:final_performance}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Accuracy} & \textbf{Precision} & \textbf{Recall} & \textbf{F1-Score} \\
\hline
k-NN (k=3) & 81.00\% & 99.12\% & 75.17\% & 85.50\% \\
Decision Tree & 91.06\% & 88.61\% & 46.98\% & 61.40\% \\
Random Forest & 90.65\% & 100.00\% & 38.26\% & 55.34\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\textbf{Note:} The k-NN accuracy of 81\% represents the final evaluation on the complete test set, while the 90\% accuracy mentioned in the k-NN chapter refers to the hyperparameter tuning phase.
